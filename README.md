# Multi-Keyword-Spotting-RNN-from-Audio
A Multi-Keyword Spotting (Multi-KWS) system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to detect multiple keywords from continuous audio streams. The project employs deep learning models like LSTM, GRU, BiRNN, and CRNN, with audio dataset augmentation for improved accuracy and robustness. Suitable for voice assistants and transcription services.
